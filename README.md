> The offen analytics software

This repository contains all source code needed to build and run __offen__, both on the server as well as on the client. See each of the READMEs in the subdirectories for instructions on how to work on that particular area of the application.

---

### Developing the application

The development setup requires `docker` and `docker-compose` to be installed.

After cloning the repository, you can build the containers and install dependencies using:

```sh
$ make setup
```

Next seed the database for the `server` application:

```sh
$ make bootstrap
```

You can test your setup by starting the application:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

which should enable you to access <http://localhost:8080/auditorium/> and use the `auditorium`
