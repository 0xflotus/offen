# Contributing to Offen

## Did you find a bug?

- If the bug is a security issue, please do not report it publicly. Instead,
refer to our [Security document](SECURITY.md).
- Please check if there is a similar issue on the GitHub issue tracker of this
repository before opening a new one.
- If you are able to do, please provide any artifacts (code snippets,
screenshots, othe recordings) that help us reproduce and fix the issue.

## Do you want to submit a Pull Request?

Please **do not** open Pull Requests that add unrequested features. We have a
product roadmap that prioritizes certain topics, so it's close to impossible for
us to merge arbitrary changes, even if they are valuable additions.

### You want to fix a bug

- If you want to fix a bug you found on the issue tracker, please make sure the
issue has a `Help wanted` label before trying to fix it. We cannot merge
possible fixes otherwise.
- Open an Pull Request and we will take care of reviewing, merging and releasing
your fix as soon as possible. Thanks!

### You have an idea for a feature and want to work on it

- Open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker describing on what you are planning
to add.
- We will get back to you and discuss when and how we can possibly add your
feature.
- If we agree on then when and how, we will create an issue in Pivotal Tracker
and assign it to you. When you are done, create a PR and we will review, merge
and release it when ready.
