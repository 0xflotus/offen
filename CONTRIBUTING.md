# Contributing to Offen

## Did you find a bug?

- If the bug is a security issue, please do not report it publicly. Instead,
refer to our [Security document](SECURITY.md).
- Please check if there is a similar issue on the GitHub issue tracker of this
repository before opening a new one.
- If you are able to do, please provide any artifacts (code snippets,
screenshots, othe recordings) that help us reproduce and fix the issue.

## Do you want to submit a Pull Request?

Please **do not** open Pull Requests that add unrequested features. We have a
product roadmap that prioritizes certain topics, so it's close to impossible for us to merge arbitrary features, even if they are valuable additions. You can check our [blog][] or our [Twitter][twitter] to see what we are currently working on.
