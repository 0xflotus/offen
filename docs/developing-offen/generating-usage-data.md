# Generating Usage Data for Development

As all usage data is encrypted and bound to user keys it is not possible to script the generation of seed data used for development. In the default development setup, the index page at <http://localhost:8080> deploys the Offen script using the "develop" account that is available using the development login. This means you can manually create usage data by simply visiting this index page.
